# bash-tools

workflow.sh -- automates copying org notes from my org directory on emacs in my general Notes directory and then
commits and pushes to my remote git repo. This script needs gcm to be setup, also change paths in the script, I 
made it general at first by taking command line arguments but I didn't want to always write the directory names 
so I inserted the names directly in the script because they have the same names on every single one of my devices.
